# Rename or Move File / Path

When changing a file name or moving a file to a new path:

1. **Create** the new file at the target path (with updated content, e.g. import paths or comments that mention the path).
2. **Find and update all references** to the old path or name (imports, requires, configs, scripts, docs, comments).
3. **Document** the change: update READMEs, SKILLs, or in-file comments that describe the path or how to use it.
4. **Delete** the old file only after references and docs are updated.

Use project-wide search (e.g. grep for the old filename or path) to ensure no references are missed.
